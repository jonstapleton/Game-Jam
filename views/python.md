# PyGame

**PyGame** is a Python framework for creating 2D games. It helps with creating visuals, but the programming is up to you. Use the following steps to help you get everything set up.

### Step 0: Tools

You will need a few pieces of software before you are ready to make games with PyGame. Here is a list of some options:

1. [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)
3. A text editor (like [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) *optional*
4. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) *optional*

You can also follow the steps below for more detailed information on downloading everything.

### Step 1: Download Python

Go to [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download Python. Click the yellow button that says `Download Python 3.7.4`. Follow the steps in the installation program. When it asks if you want to add Python to the `PATH` variable, click `Yes`.

### Step 2: Setting Up Pygame

The easiest way to set up Pygame is with the **Terminal** or **Command Prompt**. 

**Mac Instructions**

1. Press `Cmd + Space` to open up the launcher search bar
2. Type `Terminal` and press `Enter`
3. In the terminal, navigate to the location where you would like to make your game
4. Make a folder to store your game files by entering this command: `mkdir mygame` (you can name the folder whatever you want; you don't have to use the name "mygame")
5. Enter the folder by entering this command: `cd mygame`
6. Now, install Pygame into your game folder by entering this command: `python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`
7. Check to see if the installation worked by opening one of the included examples: `python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens`

**PC Instructions**

1. Click into the Start search bar
2. Type `cmd` and press `Enter`
3. In the terminal, navigate to the location where you would like to make your game
4. Make a folder to store your game files by entering this command: `mkdir mygame` (you can name the folder whatever you want; you don't have to use the name "mygame")
5. Enter the folder by entering this command: `cd mygame`
6. Now, install Pygame into your game folder by entering this command: `python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`
7. Check to see if the installation worked by opening one of the included examples: `python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens`

### Step 3: Text Editor *optional*

The text editor is the software you will use to write your code. Click one of the links below to download:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)

Both are free. Choose one, they are very similar so don't get too worried about it.

### Step 4: GitHub Desktop *optional*

GitHub Desktop is an excellent tool for sharing code and managing versions. We strongly recommend that you download it if you have not already. Use the link below:

* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

You don't need it, but it makes things very simple for you.
