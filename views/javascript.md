# Phaser

**Phaser** is a 2D game framework for making 2D web games. It uses javascript, and there are a lot of resources online to help you figure out the details. Find the example code here: [https://github.com/HarrisonburgHighSchool/Phaser-Template](https://github.com/HarrisonburgHighSchool/Phaser-Template)

# How to Start

Setting up Phaser is a little complicated if you have never created a web server before. Here is a step-by-step process for getting everything set up. You can also use the instructions at [this link](https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3) if you prefer.

# Step 0: Tools

You will need a few pieces of software before you are ready to write web games with Phaser. Here is a list of some options:

1. A text editor (like [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. A web server (Node or Python recommended, see below)
3. The [Phaser library](https://phaser.io/download)
4. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) *optional*

You can also follow the steps below for more detailed information on downloading everything.

# Step 1: Text Editor

The text editor is the software you will use to write your code. Click one of the links below to download:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)

Both are free. Choose one, they are very similar so don't get too worried about it.

# Step 1.5: GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is an excellent tool for sharing code and managing versions. We strongly recommend that you download it if you have not already. Use the link below:

* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

You don't need it, but it makes things very simple for you.

# Step 2: Phaser

Phaser is simply a bunch of Javascript files you can put in your project folder. There are many ways to download the files, but we recommend that you **clone the Game Jam Phaser Example** using GitHub Desktop. Here are instructions for that:

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**
2. Click `Clone a Repository` (if you don't see a button, go to `File > Clone a Repository`)
3. Click the `URL` tab
4. Paste this link into the text box: [https://github.com/HarrisonburgHighSchool/Phaser-Template](https://github.com/HarrisonburgHighSchool/Phaser-Template)
5. Click `Clone`

# Step 3: Open the Code

The cloning process will download all the files for you, and package them up into a folder called a **repository**. You can then **open the code by clicking the button** that says `Open in Atom` or `Open in Visual Studio Code`, depending on which one you chose.

# Step 4: Run the Code

To quickly run the code, find the project folder you downloaded and double-click the `index.html` file. Here are some more specific instructions:

### With GitHub Desktop

1. Go to `Repository > Show in Explorer` (for Mac, `Repository > Show in Finder`)
2. Double-click the `index.html` file

### Without GitHub Desktop

1. Open your the File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac)
2. Search for `phaser-example`
3. Open the `phaser-example` folder
4. Double-click `index.html`

### Step 4.5: Run the Code Using the Web Server *optional*

The code you downloaded is an example that already works. This is the tricky part; there are two ways of accomplishing this task. Choose one:

### Method 1: Python

1. Make sure you have download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Open up a **Command Prompt** or **Terminal**
  * For Windows: type `cmd` into the `Start` search box, and press `Enter`.
  * For Mac: Type `Cmd + Space` to open up the launcher, and type `terminal`. Press `Enter`.
3. Use `cd` commands to enter your project folder, then enter `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the terminal or prompt.
4. 6. Open your browser (we recommend [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and go to [localhost:8000](localhost:8000) to see your game.

### Method 2: Node

1. Make sure you have downloaded [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Use the free version, which requires you to make an account.
2. Open up a **Command Prompt** or **Terminal**
  * For Windows: type `cmd` into the `Start` search box, and press `Enter`.
  * For Mac: Type `Cmd + Space` to open up the launcher, and type `terminal`. Press `Enter`.
3. In the terminal or prompt window, type `npm -v` to check to see if NodeJS is installed correctly.
4. If NodeJS is installed, run the following command to download the server: `npm install http-server -g`.
5. Use `cd` commands to enter your project folder, then enter `http-server` in the terminal or prompt.
6. Open your browser (we recommend [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and go to [localhost:8080](localhost:8080) to see your game.
