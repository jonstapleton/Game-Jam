# Pico-8

Pico-8 is a virtual console that features a code editor, sprite creator, and several useful functions to streamline the game creation process. Pico-8 is very limited: the whole screen is only 128 x 128 pixels, meaning that it has a pixelated, retro look. 

### Demos:

Here are some games made with Pico-8:

### Step 2: Write and Test Your Code

You write and test your code all in the Pico-8 program.

2. To write code, press `Esc`

The editor will open up. Paste the following code into the editor to get started:

```lua
function _init()

end

function _update()

end

function _draw()
  rectfill(10, 10, 40, 40)
  print('hello, world', 0, 0)
end
```

Once you have pasted your code, you need to run it to see what it does.

1. Hit `Esc`
2. Save your file by typing `save nameofgame` in the black screen and pressing `Enter` (you can put whatever you want to name your game, it doesn't have to be 'nameofgame')
3. Run your game by typing `run` and pressing `Enter`

### Resources

Now that you are set up, go check out some games made with Pico-8. 

Go to the black console screen in Pico-8. Type `splore` and hit `Enter`. You will be able to load and run other games made with Pico-8 on this screen. You can even look at the code! Check out the following resources for information on how to use Pico-8 to make games:
