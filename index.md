# Welcome to the 2019 JMUxHCPS Game Jam!

We are looking forward to making games with you this Friday and Saturday. During the next two days, you will have lots of time to collaborate with peers, learn new coding or design techniques, and ultimately create something amazing! This site is the home page for all the resources you might need to create awesome games. This site is being updated all the time, so check back frequently to see what information, tips, examples, and demos have been added.

### About Languages, Etc.

We want everyone to have a chance to show their skills in a language they are comfortable with, or learn something new. We have compiled (and in some cases, created) resources for people to make all sorts of games using different tools. Check out the links below for different ideas of tools you can use to create games.
